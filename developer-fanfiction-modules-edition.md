# Developer FanFiction: Modules Edition

## Abstract

The year is 2025 and ES Modules are everywhere. Not only can developers import JavaScript, but they can also import JSON, HTML, CSS, and WebAssembly. Module attributes can be used to set policy on a per module basis, Import Maps can be used to create 0(1) lookup for any specifier, Web Bundles can be used to preload resources, and things mostly work the same across JavaScript runtimes.

Join us on a journey into a speculative future built upon the standards and specification work that is being worked on today.

## A bit more information

Folks are busy writing modules today, but many are writing ES Modules in a way that is not compatible with how modules can actually be written. It is hard for folks to get excited about the changes they need to make to their process if they can't see what the future is going to look like. This talk will paint a picture of what the future could look like so folks can get excited about adopting standard ES Modules
